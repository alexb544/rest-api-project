# Student Records API

## Overview
This project uses a REST API for managing system records for university students. 
- Provides 7 endpoints (5 CRUD + 2 filtering) allowing users to create, read, update, and delete student records, as well as filter by major or a given GPA threshold.
- Endpoints provide proper HTTP status codes and have input validation with explicit checks that raise `HTTPException`s.
- Implements an SQLite database for data storage that persists across server restarts.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
1. Clone this repository:
```sh
git clone "https://github.com/alexb544/rest-api-project.git"
```
2. Create a virtual environment in the root directory, then activate it:
```sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate 
```
3. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- You can verify installation via: `pip list | grep fastapi` & `uvicorn --version`

### Starting the server
4. Run:
```sh
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
5. `CTRL + Click` on the link provided in your terminal `http://localhost:8000`, this opens a new webpage in your browser. 
- You can add `/docs` to the end of the URL to use FastAPI's user-friendly UI page.

## Testing
To test API calls, the easiest way is with FastAPI's `/docs` interface.

Once on the `/docs` page, click on any of the listed endpoints under the `default` section to expand it. Click the `Try it out` button at the top to test it, then enter in the required parameters (if any) and click `Execute`. Your API call will be executed and any information about it will be displayed below, as well as in the terminal. 

### Note about database initialization
> The database is automatically initialized in `main.py`, which creates a `.db` file that stores any data you modify while testing. When you call one of the endpoints, they'll automatically connect to the this database file and commit any changes made.
